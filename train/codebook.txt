"tSubject"  - This is the individual Subject Number from 1 to 30               
"tActivity" - This is the activity for the Subject should occur 6 times per each 			subject number.  Also will have the 6 values of 			"LAYING","SITTING","STANDING","WALKING",
			"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","WALKING_UPSTAIRS"   

Everything below this is the data measured on the data filtered down to the mean and standard deviation. This has been put together based on the unique combination of tSubject and tActivity since there were 30 subject and 6 Activities these values will repeat 180 times for that unique combination set.
